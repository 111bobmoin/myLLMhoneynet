    "Port 443 on edge-fw has a config leak vulnerability referencing a private key file, which is inconsistent with HTTPS service expectations.",
    "The SSH service on bastion-01 has a weak credentials vulnerability but does not loop back to a trap, indicating a potential oversight.",
    "The HTTP service on app-01 has an outdated SSH vulnerability, which is irrelevant to the service and indicates a mismatch.",
    "The trap loop on bastion-01 points to the same file multiple times without a valid exit, suggesting a design flaw.",
    "The file upload vulnerability on fileserver-01 references a passwords.txt file, which is not a typical target for file uploads, raising plausibility concerns."
