  "### Overall Assessment",
  "Attacker's Objectives**: Initial exploitation of SSH on bastion-01 with low-level probing on app-01. No successful lateral movement or data theft has been established yet.",
  "Capability Maturity**: Moderate at best, focusing on gaining access rather than advanced exploitation or data exfiltration.",
  "Protocols/Services**: Successful SSH attacks indicate a focus on remote access. HTTPS querying implies an interest in API accessibility.",
  "Risk Level**: Increased risk on bastion-01; other hosts remain unsecured but unobserved, indicating potential avenues for future attacks."
